<sect1>Starting Sylpheed for the first time

<p>
When starting Sylpheed for the first time, you will be 
guided through the first basic steps of the setup.
First a pop-up window will show up and you will be asked
to define the directory Sylpheed will use to store your
messages and folders. This directory will be created under
your home directory (or under C:\windows\Application Data\Sylpheed
on windows). The default name for this directory is "Mail".

Then the account preferences window shows up. Based on
your configuration (local UNIX mailbox or POP account),
read one of the following sections for the next steps
of the configuration.

<sect1>Setup for reading your Unix mailbox in a hurry<p>
<itemize>
<item>In the configuration menu, select "Create new account".
<item>In the <ref id="Basic"> tab, name the account. You can select this account to be the default account ("Usually used").
<item>Enter your name and e-mail address.
<item>To select your local unix mailbox, in the Protocol box you select "None (local)".
<item>When you select this option, the "Server for receiving" is greyed out, since this is not relevant. You can enter the server to send (SMTP) in this tab also.
</itemize>
Settings in the remaining tabs can usually be left at default values.

The <ref id="Receive"> tab is not used in this setup, since you are not polling a server, your mail is delivered to you.

In the <ref id="Send"> tab you can select headers and SMTP authentication.

In the <ref id="Compose"> tab you can define your signature file.

In the <ref id="Advanced"> tab you can edit the portnumbers for the servers you will be using. This normally will need no change.

This is basically everything you need to start using Sylpheed for local mailboxes. You can select "Message -> receive new mail" or press the <ref id="shortcut"> and see if there is new mail!
