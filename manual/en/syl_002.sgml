<sect1>Setup for reading your Unix mailbox in a hurry
<p>
In the configuration menu, select "Create new account"
<p>
In the "Basic" tab, enter the relevant data. You name the account, enter your name and e-mail address, etc. You can select this account to be the default account ("Usually used"). To select your local unix mailbox, in the Protocol box you select "None (local)".

<p>
When you select this option, the "Server for receiving" is greyed out, since this is not relevant. You can enter the server to send (SMTP) in this tab also.
<p>
The "Receive" tab is not used in this setup, since you are not polling a server, your mail is delivered to you.

<p>
In the "Send" tab you can set up some more settings.

<p>
In the "Advanced" tab you can edit the portnumbers for the servers you will be using. This normally will need no change.
<p>
This is basically everything you need to start using Sylpheed for local mailboxes. You can press Alt-I or select "Message -> receive new mail" and see if there is new mail!
