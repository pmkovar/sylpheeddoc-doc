    <title>Reading a message </title>
    <para>
Reading a message is quite simple. If you have the message pane 
within view, all you need to do is once click the message you 
want to read and it already appears in the message view. 
When you double-click the message, a separate window will open, 
showing you the message. You can close the opened window by 
pressing ESCape or clicking the &apos;close&apos; button.

    <title>Viewing Multipart MIME (Attached Files) </title>
    <para>
When a message contains an attachment, you can have several 
options to view the information in that file. Sylpheed can 
be able, when compiled against the proper libraries, to 
display images &quot;inline&quot;. This means you can click the name 
of the image and you can see it in the lower part of the 
message screen.
</para>
    <para>
How do you see an attachment is in an e- mail?
</para>
    <para>
This shows through an extra section that appears between 
the summary pane and the message view. In it you can see 
the separate parts of the e-mail. Sometimes you can&apos;t 
view the contents of an attachment directly. Then you 
can rightclick the name of the file and select &quot;OPEN&quot; 
from the appearing menu. If this does not work, it means 
that the extension of the file is not recognized through 
the directives in the mailcap file. In that case you 
can always use the &quot;Save as...&quot; option in the popup menu, 
save the file to disk and open the file with the proper 
program.
</para>

  <section>
    <title>Extending and Closing Threads </title>
    <para>
Sylpheed offers the option to view messages in threads. 
Threads are no more than series of e-mails in a logical 
sequence. Suppose 15 people sent you a mail called 
&quot;Re: bananas&quot;. You can&apos;t easily tell which one is the 
first and which one is the last in that sequence.
</para>
    <para>
By activating threads (summary menu), Sylpheed will 
attempt to show the sequence of mails as they were 
written/sent from first to last.
</para>
    <para>
To undo the threads view, you simply select the same 
menu option again and the e-mails are displayed in 
standard order again.
</para>

    <title>Message Operations (Moving, Deleting, etc.) </title>
    <para>
Sylpheed gives you many ways to manage your messages. 
You can move them to new mailboxes, or delete them. 
Through the message menu (see that section for more 
details) plenty of options are available to do with 
your e-mails what you want done. The advantage of 
moving messages to different mailboxes (also see 
Filtering for that, as described in the Configuration 
menu section) is that you keep an overview of your 
inbox. Suppose you are collecting e-mails in there 
of 8 different subjects. And you are looking for a 
specific one on a specific subject. That will give 
you a lot of work, trying to find the right message. 
Creating a new mail folder for each subject, and 
moving the messages to that new one, lifts a lot of 
work afterwards from your hands.

  <section>
    <title>URL in a Message </title>
    <para>
At times you may find a URL in a message. A URL is 
a link to a website. Usually it is shown in the 
form &quot;http://www.somewhere.something&quot;.
</para>
    <para>
If you want to visit that website, you only need to 
double-click the URL, and the default webbrowser 
you set up (usually Netscape) will activate and load 
the website.
</para>
    <para>
In the configuration options, Sylpheed has a color 
setting specific for URL&apos;s so you can spot a URL easily.
