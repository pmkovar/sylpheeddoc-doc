Sylpheed offers three powerfull tools to help you automatically
and efficently manage you mails. These tools are:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
  The <computeroutput>filters</computeroutput>, that let you sort you incoming messages and move
  them into your folders based on their sender, their content,
  using regular expressions.
 </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
  The <computeroutput>actions</computeroutput> feature is a convenient way for the user to launch 
  external commands to process a complete message file including 
  headers and body or just one of its parts.
  It allows also the use of an external command to filter the whole 
  text or just a selected part in the message window or in the 
  compose window.
 </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
  The <computeroutput>templates</computeroutput> that let you pre-define complete messages
  leaving placeholders in the text to be filled at composition time.

    <title>Filters </title>
    <para>
Written by Nick Selby (sylpheed@nickselby.com)
</para>
    <para>
Sylpheed provides powerful filters to allow users to automatically 
pre-sort incoming mail based on a set of rules that the user defines. 
As a most simple example, let&apos;s say you work at the Acme Grommet Company, 
and you want all e-mail from your co-workers to be placed in one mailbox. 
To accomplish this, you would set up a filter that would place all mail 
whose &quot;From&quot; header includes the phrase &quot;acmegrommet.com&quot; into a specific 
mailbox.
</para>
    <para>
Sylpheed allows you much more control than just that simple setup; 
you may create filters based on several variables, including an 
&quot;If this AND that&quot; or &quot;If the message contains this OR does NOT contain that&quot;
etc. It&apos;s very cool.
</para>

    <title>Finding The Filter Setting Dialog </title>
    <para>
The filter settings dialog is located in the <computeroutput>Configuration</computeroutput> menu, 
under the title &quot;Filter Setting&quot; or from the <computeroutput>Tools</computeroutput> menu, under in
the <computeroutput>Create filter rules</computeroutput> sub menu. You may also use establish a 
keyboard shortcut (see Keyboard Shortcuts).

    <title>Setting Up Filters</title>
    <para>
Operator(s) and Processing instructions combine to create a Filter Rule.

* Operators
The dialog&apos;s first setting option establishes the Operator, the variable 
that will tell the filter what specific text to look for to trigger a 
filter. Each Filter Rule may have up to two operator sets.
</para>
    <para>
Each Operator variable contains three sections: <computeroutput>Header</computeroutput>, 
<computeroutput>Keyword</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>Predicate</computeroutput>.
</para>
    <para>
Header is a drop-down box which defines in which message header 
Sylpheed&apos;s filter will search. Choices range from <computeroutput>Subject</computeroutput> 
to <computeroutput>X-Mailer</computeroutput>. </para>
    <para><computeroutput>Keyword</computeroutput> is a a text box in which you may enter the text 
for which the filter will search. </para>
    <para>Predicate allows you to choose to filter based on whether the operator 
contains, or does not contain, the text you enter in the Keyword field.
</para>
    <para>
Example: Create an Operator in which the X-Mailer field of an incoming 
message contains the word &apos;Eudora&apos;.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 1. Under the <computeroutput>Header</computeroutput> drop-down box, select 
  <computeroutput>X-Mailer</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 2. In the <computeroutput>Keyword</computeroutput> text box, type &apos;eudora&apos; 
  (case insensitive)
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 3. Determine appropriate Predicate setting. Default 
  is <computeroutput>Contains</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The second Operator setting, which is set identically to the 
first, also allows the user to select an AND/OR setting 
declaring the relationship between the two operators. 
</para>
    <para>
Example: Create an Operator set which will process mail with 
a <computeroutput>From</computeroutput> header of bob@acmegrommet.com AND a subject
of &quot;2001 Spring Grommet Collection&quot;</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 1. Under the first Operator set&apos;s Header drop-down 
  box, select <computeroutput>From</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 2. In the <computeroutput>Keyword</computeroutput> text box, type 
  &apos;bob@acmegrommet.com&apos; (case insensitive).
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 3. Leave <computeroutput>Predicate</computeroutput> setting on default, 
  <computeroutput>Contains</computeroutput>
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 4. Leave <computeroutput>AND/OR</computeroutput> box on default setting, <computeroutput>and</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 5. Under the second Operator set&apos;s <computeroutput>Header</computeroutput> 
  drop-down box, select <computeroutput>Subject</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Step 6. In the <computeroutput>Keyword</computeroutput> text box, type 
  &apos;2001 spring grommet collection&apos; (case insensitive).
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>

    <title>Message Processing </title>
    <para>
Once you&apos;ve established the Operator(s) that will define 
which messages will be processed, it&apos;s time to tell 
Sylpheed what to do with messages that match the operator(s). 
You may choose between two radio button-selected settings: 
<computeroutput>Destination</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>Don&apos;t Receive</computeroutput>.
</para>
    <para>
Selecting <computeroutput>Destinations</computeroutput> will enable you to route 
the mail into a mailbox which you specify.
</para>
    <para>
Selecting <computeroutput>Don&apos;t Receive</computeroutput> will instruct Sylpheed 
to not download messages with that operator. Note that with 
<computeroutput>Don&apos;t Receive</computeroutput>, Sylpheed merely leaves the message 
on your mailserver - it does not delete it. </para>
    <para>To specify a mailbox to which you want the message transfered, 
click on the radio button to the left of the word <computeroutput>Destination</computeroutput>
in the dialog. (Currently, in order to specify a mailbox you 
must have created that mailbox prior to activating the Filter 
Setting dialog.) Clicking the <computeroutput>Select</computeroutput> button will open 
a pop-up window containing all mail folders currently active 
in your copy of Sylpheed. Select the mailbox you wish by either </para>

    <title>Filter Registration </title>
    <para>
Now that you have set the Operator and the Processing Rule, 
all that&apos;s left to do is tell Sylpheed to save the entire 
Filter Rule. <emphasis>If you skip this step, the filter won&apos;t work</emphasis>.
</para>

    <title>Registered Rule Order </title>
    <para>
One caveat about all this: the order in which Filter Rules 
are created could adversely affect your intended message sorting, 
and one needs to consider this when creating or updating Filter Rules. 
</para>
    <para>
For example, a Filter Rule saying, &quot;Move anything containing &apos;ABC&apos; 
to Mailbox X&quot; listed above another Filter Rule saying &quot;Move anything 
containing &apos;ABCDEF&apos; to Mailbox Y&quot; will cause the latter of these 
filters not to process. 
</para>
    <para>
Think about the way Sylpheed goes down its list: first, it would say..
&quot;Hmm, any messages with ABC? Ah, there&apos;s one! Move it&quot;. 
Then it would think, &quot;Okay, any messages with ABCDEF?&quot; 
To which the answer would be &quot;no&quot; - that ABCDEF was already 
filtered because it contained &quot;ABC&quot;.
</para>
    <para>
Bummer.
</para>
    <para>
In order to avoid this, you must ensure that the more complex 
Filter Rule is processed first, by placing it higher than a 
similar, conflicting Filter Rule. 
</para>
    <para>
To move a Registered Rule higher or lower within the Registered 
Rule box, select the rule you would like to move, and click on 
the <computeroutput>Up</computeroutput> or <computeroutput>Down</computeroutput> buttons. This will &quot;move&quot; the 
rule up or down, above or below a potentially conflicting Filter Rule.

    <title>How to Filter Messages </title>

Filtering messages can be done in several ways:</para>

  Sylpheed automatically filters incoming mail from 
  POP servers.
 </para>
      </listitem>

        <para>
  If you incorporate mail from a unix mailbox, then 
  in the <computeroutput>Common preferences</computeroutput> (<computeroutput>Configuration</computeroutput> menu), 
  you need to check the box called <computeroutput>Filter on incorporation</computeroutput>. 
  You find this box in the <computeroutput>Receive</computeroutput> tab in the space 
  <computeroutput>Local spool</computeroutput>.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  You can also select the option <computeroutput>Filter messages</computeroutput> 
  from the Summary menu.
 </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Please note that, at time of writing, Sylpheed does -NOT YET- 
has filtering of IMAP messages enabled.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Filtering mail with Procmail </title>
    <para>
If you feel that Sylpheed has not enough options to perform 
filtering for you, then you can look at Sylpheed Claws which 
has more options for filtering. You can find the Claws version 
(the cutting edge, experimental version of Sylpheed) 
sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net.
</para>
    <para>
Another option, if you do not want to work with an experimental 
version of Sylpheed, is Procmail. Procmail is a powerful mail 
filtering program that is triggered from the Mail Transport 
Agent (i.e. Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail). Procmail is called by 
default from these programs after receiving e-mail.
</para>
    <para>
The trick to procmail is to tell it that mail has to be filtered 
into MH mail folders. This is not difficult though.
</para>
    <para>
Normally procmail moves mail into MBOX format, this is one large 
file containing all mails in a folder. MH uses separate files 
for each e-mail. All you need to do is point the destination 
of a procmail rule to &lt;destination folder&gt;/.  
It is the &quot;slash dot&quot; that does the trick.</para>

    <title>Actions </title>
    <para>
The following section is a copy of 
<ulink url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/index.html">Melvin&apos;s page</ulink>.

</para>
    <para>
The &quot;actions&quot; feature is a convenient way for the user to 
launch external commands to process a complete message file 
including headers and body or just one of its parts. 
It allows also the use of an external command to filter the 
whole text or just a selected part in the message window or 
in the compose window. This is a generic tool that allows 
to do any uncommon actions on the messages, and thus extends 
the possibilities of Sylpheed. For example, Sylpheed does not 
include the rot13 cyphering algorithm popular in some 
newsgroups. It does not support natively armored encryption 
or clear signing. It does not support uuencoded messages. 
As all these features can be handled by external programs, 
the actions provide a convenient way to use them from the menu bar.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Usage </title>
    <para>
To create a new action, go to the <computeroutput>Configuration</computeroutput> menu,
select the <computeroutput>Actions...</computeroutput> entry. The <computeroutput>Actions setting</computeroutput>
dialog offers to enter the Menu name that will trigger the command. 
The created menu will be found in the <computeroutput>Tools -&gt; Actions</computeroutput> submenu. 
By inserting a slash / in the menu name, you create a submenu.</para>
    <para>The command is entered in the Command line entry. Note that 
Sylpheed stores every single email in a separate file. This allows 
to use the following syntax for the command:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  <computeroutput>%f</computeroutput> denotes the file name of the selected message. 
  If you selected more than one, then the command will be 
  launched for each message with the appropriate file name.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  <computeroutput>%F</computeroutput> denotes the list of the file names of the 
  selected message. If only one message is selected, 
  this amounts to <computeroutput>%f</computeroutput>, but if more messages are 
  selected, then the command will be launched only once 
  with the list of the file names. (You can use both 
  <computeroutput>%f</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>%F</computeroutput> in one command: then the 
  command will be launched for each selected message 
  with the name of this message and with the list of 
  all selected messages. I did not find a practical 
  example for this.).
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  <computeroutput>%p</computeroutput> denotes the current selected message part 
  of a multipart message. The part is decoded accordingly. 
  If the message is not a multipart message, it denotes 
  the message body.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Prepending <computeroutput>&gt;</computeroutput>: this will allow you to send 
  to the command&apos;s standard input a text that you will 
  enter in a dialog window.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Prepending <computeroutput>*</computeroutput>: this will allow you to send to 
  the command&apos;s standard input a text that you will enter 
  in a dialog window. But in contrast to prepending 
  <computeroutput>&gt;</computeroutput>, the entered text is hidden 
  (useful when entering passwords).
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Appending an ampersand <computeroutput>&amp;</computeroutput>: this will run 
  the command asynchronously. That means &quot;fire and forget&quot;. 
  Sylpheed won&apos;t wait for the command to finish, nor will 
  it catch its output or its error messages.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Prepending the vertical bar <computeroutput>|</computeroutput> (pipe-in): 
  this will send the current displayed text or the current 
  selected text from the message view or the compose 
  window to the command standard input. The command will 
  silently fail if more than one message is selected.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Appending the vertical bar <computeroutput>|</computeroutput> (pipe-out): this 
  will replace the current displayed text or the current 
  selected text from the message window or the compose 
  window with the command standard output. The command 
  will silently fail if more than one message is selected.
 </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
  Appending the &quot;greater than&quot; sign <computeroutput>&gt;</computeroutput> will 
  insert the command output in the message. The difference 
  between the trailing <computeroutput>|</computeroutput> is that no text will be 
  deleted or replaced. Most used when composing mails to 
  insert text.
 </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para><emphasis>Note</emphasis>: It is not possible to use actions containing 
<computeroutput>%f</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>%F</computeroutput> or <computeroutput>%p</computeroutput> from the compose window.
</para>
    <para>
When a command is run, and unless it is run asynchronously, 
Sylpheed will be insensitive to any interaction and it will wait 
for the command to finish. If the command takes too long 
(5 seconds), it will popup a dialog window allowing to stop it. 
This dialog will also be displayed as soon as the command has 
some output: error messages or even its standard output when 
the command is not a &quot;pipe-out&quot; command. When multiple commands 
are being run, they are run in parallel and each command output 
is separated from the outputs of the others.
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Examples </title>
    <para>
Here are some examples that are listed in the same syntax 
as used for storing the actions list. You can copy and past 
the definition in your <computeroutput>~/.sylpheed/actionsrc</computeroutput> file 
(exit Sylpheed before). The syntax is very simple: one line 
per action, each action contains the menu name and the command 
line separated by a colon and a space &quot;: &quot;. 
Alternatively, you can use <computeroutput>Configuration -&gt; Actions...</computeroutput> 
and for each example enter a menu name and copy&amp;paste the 
text after the colon and space &quot;: &quot; in the command definition.

    <para>
With Sylpheed you can define mail templates to use when replying
to messages. A template can contain raw text (that will be inserted
in the composed mail without any change), and placeholders that are
replaced at composition time by the actual value of the selected
fields from the original message.
</para>
    <para>
A typical use of the template could be to define the legal notice
to be appended to your messages (the usual notice that contains a
text like: &quot;here are my own words and not those of my company, my
boss is not liable for them, bla, bla, bla&quot;).
</para>
    <para>
To define a new template, in the <computeroutput>Configuration</computeroutput> menu select
the <computeroutput>Templates</computeroutput> entry and fill the form:</para>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="snapshots/template..png"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>
The name parameter is used to identify each template, this name
will then appear in the <computeroutput>Tools/Templates</computeroutput> menu in the
composition window.
The content of the <computeroutput>To</computeroutput> field will be appended to the original
content of the corresponding field in the message you are composing.
The content of the <computeroutput>Subject</computeroutput> field will replace the orignal subject
of the message you are composing.
</para>
    <para>
In the upper pane, type in the text you want to put in the template,
use the <computeroutput>Symbols</computeroutput> button to open a help window that contains
the description of all the placeholders you can use in a template
(there is one for the sender, one for the date, one for the message
ID, ...), then use the <computeroutput>Register</computeroutput> button to  validate the
template. If you do not register the template, when leaving the form
the template will be canceled. To modify an existing template, select
it in the lower pane, modify its text, then use the <computeroutput>Substitute</computeroutput>
button. As you may guess, the <computeroutput>Delete</computeroutput> button removes the selected
template. Finally validate your changes with the <computeroutput>OK</computeroutput> button.
If you use the <computeroutput>Cancel</computeroutput> button, the form is closed and your changes
are lost (deleted templates are back, added templates are lost).

</para>
    <para>
To use a template, open the composition window and select the template
from the <computeroutput>Tools/Templates</computeroutput> menu. You can then choose to insert
the template into your message or to completely replace the text of the
message by the template. This only affects the body of the message.
If you choose to insert the template, its text will be inserted at the
cursor location.
</para>
    <para>
The placeholders are taken from the source message when replying, so
they have no meaning when composing a new message.
