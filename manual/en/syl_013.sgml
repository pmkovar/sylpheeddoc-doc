<sect>Filters, actions and templates
<p>
Sylpheed offers three powerfull tools to help you automatically
and efficently manage you mails. These tools are:

<itemize>
	<item>
		The <it>filters</it>, that let you sort you incoming messages and move
		them into your folders based on their sender, their content,
		using regular expressions.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>actions</it> feature is a convenient way for the user to launch 
		external commands to process a complete message file including 
		headers and body or just one of its parts.
		It allows also the use of an external command to filter the whole 
		text or just a selected part in the message window or in the 
		compose window.
	</item>
	<item>
		The <it>templates</it> that let you pre-define complete messages
		leaving placeholders in the text to be filled at composition time.
	</item>
</itemize>



<sect1>Filters
<p>
Written by Nick Selby (sylpheed@nickselby.com)
<p>
Sylpheed provides powerful filters to allow users to automatically 
pre-sort incoming mail based on a set of rules that the user defines. 
As a most simple example, let's say you work at the Acme Grommet Company, 
and you want all e-mail from your co-workers to be placed in one mailbox. 
To accomplish this, you would set up a filter that would place all mail 
whose "From" header includes the phrase "acmegrommet.com" into a specific 
mailbox.
<p>
Sylpheed allows you much more control than just that simple setup; 
you may create filters based on several variables, including an 
"If this AND that" or "If the message contains this OR does NOT contain that"
etc. It's very cool.

<sect2>Finding The Filter Setting Dialog
<p>
The filter settings dialog is located in the <it>Configuration</it> menu, 
under the title "Filter Setting" or from the <it>Tools</it> menu, under in
the <it>Create filter rules</it> sub menu. You may also use establish a 
keyboard shortcut (see Keyboard Shortcuts).

</sect2>
<sect2>Setting Up Filters<p>
Operator(s) and Processing instructions combine to create a Filter Rule.

* Operators
The dialog's first setting option establishes the Operator, the variable 
that will tell the filter what specific text to look for to trigger a 
filter. Each Filter Rule may have up to two operator sets.
<p>
Each Operator variable contains three sections: <it>Header</it>, 
<it>Keyword</it> and <it>Predicate</it>.
<p>
Header is a drop-down box which defines in which message header 
Sylpheed's filter will search. Choices range from <it>Subject</it> 
to <it>X-Mailer</it>. 

<it>Keyword</it> is a a text box in which you may enter the text 
for which the filter will search. 

Predicate allows you to choose to filter based on whether the operator 
contains, or does not contain, the text you enter in the Keyword field.
<p>
Example: Create an Operator in which the X-Mailer field of an incoming 
message contains the word 'Eudora'.

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the <it>Header</it> drop-down box, select 
		<it>X-Mailer</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 'eudora' 
		(case insensitive)
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Determine appropriate Predicate setting. Default 
		is <it>Contains</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

The second Operator setting, which is set identically to the 
first, also allows the user to select an AND/OR setting 
declaring the relationship between the two operators. 
<p>
Example: Create an Operator set which will process mail with 
a <it>From</it> header of bob@acmegrommet.com AND a subject
of "2001 Spring Grommet Collection"

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's Header drop-down 
		box, select <it>From</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'bob@acmegrommet.com' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Leave <it>AND/OR</it> box on default setting, <it>and</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5.	Under the second Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'2001 spring grommet collection' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 7. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default,
		<it>Contains</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

</sect2>

<sect2>Message Processing
<p>
Once you've established the Operator(s) that will define 
which messages will be processed, it's time to tell 
Sylpheed what to do with messages that match the operator(s). 
You may choose between two radio button-selected settings: 
<it>Destination</it> and <it>Don't Receive</it>.
<p>
Selecting <it>Destinations</it> will enable you to route 
the mail into a mailbox which you specify.
<p>
Selecting <it>Don't Receive</it> will instruct Sylpheed 
to not download messages with that operator. Note that with 
<it>Don't Receive</it>, Sylpheed merely leaves the message 
on your mailserver - it does not delete it. 

To specify a mailbox to which you want the message transfered, 
click on the radio button to the left of the word <it>Destination</it>
in the dialog. (Currently, in order to specify a mailbox you 
must have created that mailbox prior to activating the Filter 
Setting dialog.) Clicking the <it>Select</it> button will open 
a pop-up window containing all mail folders currently active 
in your copy of Sylpheed. Select the mailbox you wish by either 

<itemize>
	<item>
		(a) double clicking on the mail folder name or 
	</item>
	<item>
		(b) clicking the mail folder name and then clicking <it>OK</it>.         
	</item>
</itemize>

<p>
To specify that the message not be retrieved, and left 
on your mail server, click the radio button to the left 
of the words <it>Don't Receive</it>.

</sect2>

<sect2>Filter Registration
<p>
Now that you have set the Operator and the Processing Rule, 
all that's left to do is tell Sylpheed to save the entire 
Filter Rule. <bf>If you skip this step, the filter won't work</bf>.
<p>
The <it>Register Rules</it> configuration has three options: 
<it>Register</it>, <it>Substitute</it> and <it>Delete</it>. 

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>Register</it> saves the Filter Rule.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Substitute</it> modifies an existing registered 
		Filter Rule.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>Delete</it> will remove a previously registered 
		Filter Rule. 
	</item>
</itemize>

Example of Registering A Filter Rule: Create a Filter Rule 
that moves all mail with the subject of "Sylpheed Manual" 
into the (previously created) mail folder "Sylpheed Manual Mail".

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'sylpheed manual' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>. Leave second Operator set empty.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>Destinations</it> radio button; 
		select "Sylpheed Manual Mail" folder.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5. Click <it>Register</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize> 

Example of Substituting A Filter Rule: Modify a previously 
created Filter Rule that moves all mail with the subject 
of "Sylpheed Manual" to sort mail not to the mail folder 
"Sylpheed Manual Mail" but rather the mail folder "Sylpheed Questions"  

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. Under the first Operator set's <it>Header</it> 
		drop-down box, select <it>Subject</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. In the <it>Keyword</it> text box, type 
		'sylpheed manual' (case insensitive).
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Leave <it>Predicate</it> setting on default, 
		<it>Contains</it>. Leave second Operator set empty.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>Destinations</it> radio button; 
		select "Sylpheed Questions" folder.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 5. Click <it>Substitute</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 6. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

Example of Deleting a Filter Rule: Remove the previously 
created Filter Rule which refers to Subject:Sylpheed Questions.

<itemize>
	<item>
		Step 1. In the <it>Registered Rules</it> select box, 
		highlight the filter entitled 
		"<it>Subject:Sylpheed Manual: :::Sylpheed Questions:1:1:m</it>"
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 2. Click the <it>Delete</it> Button.
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 3. Confirm the deletion by clicking <it>Yes</it> in the 
		confirmation pop-up that asks, 
		<it>Do you really want to delete this rule?</it>
	</item>
	<item>
		Step 4. Click <it>OK</it>.
	</item>
</itemize>

</sect2>

<sect2>Registered Rule Order
<p>
One caveat about all this: the order in which Filter Rules 
are created could adversely affect your intended message sorting, 
and one needs to consider this when creating or updating Filter Rules. 
<p>
For example, a Filter Rule saying, "Move anything containing 'ABC' 
to Mailbox X" listed above another Filter Rule saying "Move anything 
containing 'ABCDEF' to Mailbox Y" will cause the latter of these 
filters not to process. 
<p>
Think about the way Sylpheed goes down its list: first, it would say..
"Hmm, any messages with ABC? Ah, there's one! Move it". 
Then it would think, "Okay, any messages with ABCDEF?" 
To which the answer would be "no" - that ABCDEF was already 
filtered because it contained "ABC".
<p>
Bummer.
<p>
In order to avoid this, you must ensure that the more complex 
Filter Rule is processed first, by placing it higher than a 
similar, conflicting Filter Rule. 
<p>
To move a Registered Rule higher or lower within the Registered 
Rule box, select the rule you would like to move, and click on 
the <it>Up</it> or <it>Down</it> buttons. This will "move" the 
rule up or down, above or below a potentially conflicting Filter Rule.   

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>How to Filter Messages
<p>
Filtering messages can be done in several ways:

<itemize>
	<item>
		Sylpheed automatically filters incoming mail from 
		POP servers.
	</item>
	<item>
		If you incorporate mail from a unix mailbox, then 
		in the <it>Common preferences</it> (<it>Configuration</it> menu), 
		you need to check the box called <it>Filter on incorporation</it>. 
		You find this box in the <it>Receive</it> tab in the space 
		<it>Local spool</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		You can also select the option <it>Filter messages</it> 
		from the Summary menu.
	</item>
</itemize>

Please note that, at time of writing, Sylpheed does -NOT YET- 
has filtering of IMAP messages enabled.

</sect1>

<sect1>Filtering mail with Procmail
<p>
If you feel that Sylpheed has not enough options to perform 
filtering for you, then you can look at Sylpheed Claws which 
has more options for filtering. You can find the Claws version 
(the cutting edge, experimental version of Sylpheed) 
sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net.
<p>
Another option, if you do not want to work with an experimental 
version of Sylpheed, is Procmail. Procmail is a powerful mail 
filtering program that is triggered from the Mail Transport 
Agent (i.e. Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail). Procmail is called by 
default from these programs after receiving e-mail.
<p>
The trick to procmail is to tell it that mail has to be filtered 
into MH mail folders. This is not difficult though.
<p>
Normally procmail moves mail into MBOX format, this is one large 
file containing all mails in a folder. MH uses separate files 
for each e-mail. All you need to do is point the destination 
of a procmail rule to &lt;destination folder&gt;/.  
It is the "slash dot" that does the trick.


<sect1>Actions
<p>
The following section is a copy of 
<url url="http://melvin.hadasht.free.fr/home/sylpheed/actions/index.html" name="Melvin's page">.

<p>
The "actions" feature is a convenient way for the user to 
launch external commands to process a complete message file 
including headers and body or just one of its parts. 
It allows also the use of an external command to filter the 
whole text or just a selected part in the message window or 
in the compose window. This is a generic tool that allows 
to do any uncommon actions on the messages, and thus extends 
the possibilities of Sylpheed. For example, Sylpheed does not 
include the rot13 cyphering algorithm popular in some 
newsgroups. It does not support natively armored encryption 
or clear signing. It does not support uuencoded messages. 
As all these features can be handled by external programs, 
the actions provide a convenient way to use them from the menu bar.

<sect2>Usage
<p>
To create a new action, go to the <it>Configuration</it> menu,
select the <it>Actions...</it> entry. The <it>Actions setting</it>
dialog offers to enter the Menu name that will trigger the command. 
The created menu will be found in the <it>Tools -> Actions</it> submenu. 
By inserting a slash / in the menu name, you create a submenu.

The command is entered in the Command line entry. Note that 
Sylpheed stores every single email in a separate file. This allows 
to use the following syntax for the command:

<itemize>
	<item>
		<it>%f</it> denotes the file name of the selected message. 
		If you selected more than one, then the command will be 
		launched for each message with the appropriate file name.
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>%F</it> denotes the list of the file names of the 
		selected message. If only one message is selected, 
		this amounts to <it>%f</it>, but if more messages are 
		selected, then the command will be launched only once 
		with the list of the file names. (You can use both 
		<it>%f</it> and <it>%F</it> in one command: then the 
		command will be launched for each selected message 
		with the name of this message and with the list of 
		all selected messages. I did not find a practical 
		example for this.).
	</item>
	<item>
		<it>%p</it> denotes the current selected message part 
		of a multipart message. The part is decoded accordingly. 
		If the message is not a multipart message, it denotes 
		the message body.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending <it>&gt;</it>: this will allow you to send 
		to the command's standard input a text that you will 
		enter in a dialog window.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending <it>*</it>: this will allow you to send to 
		the command's standard input a text that you will enter 
		in a dialog window. But in contrast to prepending 
		<it>&gt;</it>, the entered text is hidden 
		(useful when entering passwords).
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending an ampersand <it>&amp;</it>: this will run 
		the command asynchronously. That means "fire and forget". 
		Sylpheed won't wait for the command to finish, nor will 
		it catch its output or its error messages.
	</item>
	<item>
		Prepending the vertical bar <it>|</it> (pipe-in): 
		this will send the current displayed text or the current 
		selected text from the message view or the compose 
		window to the command standard input. The command will 
		silently fail if more than one message is selected.
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending the vertical bar <it>|</it> (pipe-out): this 
		will replace the current displayed text or the current 
		selected text from the message window or the compose 
		window with the command standard output. The command 
		will silently fail if more than one message is selected.
	</item>
	<item>
		Appending the "greater than" sign <it>&gt;</it> will 
		insert the command output in the message. The difference 
		between the trailing <it>|</it> is that no text will be 
		deleted or replaced. Most used when composing mails to 
		insert text.
	</item>
</itemize>

<bf>Note</bf>: It is not possible to use actions containing 
<it>%f</it>, <it>%F</it> or <it>%p</it> from the compose window.
<p>
When a command is run, and unless it is run asynchronously, 
Sylpheed will be insensitive to any interaction and it will wait 
for the command to finish. If the command takes too long 
(5 seconds), it will popup a dialog window allowing to stop it. 
This dialog will also be displayed as soon as the command has 
some output: error messages or even its standard output when 
the command is not a "pipe-out" command. When multiple commands 
are being run, they are run in parallel and each command output 
is separated from the outputs of the others.
<p>
<sect3>Examples
<p>
Here are some examples that are listed in the same syntax 
as used for storing the actions list. You can copy and past 
the definition in your <it>~/.sylpheed/actionsrc</it> file 
(exit Sylpheed before). The syntax is very simple: one line 
per action, each action contains the menu name and the command 
line separated by a colon and a space ": ". 
Alternatively, you can use <it>Configuration -> Actions...</it> 
and for each example enter a menu name and copy&amp;paste the 
text after the colon and space ": " in the command definition.
