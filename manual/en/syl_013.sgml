<sect>Handling MIME types

<sect1>How Sylpheed checks for Mime types<p>

(Thanks to Adriaan Penning for writing this!)<p>

Two files, mime.types and mailcap, are involved in determining the mime type of an attachment, and the application associated with that mime type. The mime.types file is used to determine the mimetype of attachments you add when composing a message. The mime.types file consists of lines like:<p>

application/pdf                    pdf<p>

Sylpheed looks for this file in SYSCONFDIR (determined at compile time), /etc/ and $HOME/.sylpheed/ 

If this file doesn't exist or has the wrong format, every attachment will have 	`application/octet-stream' as it's mime type, so the recipients mail client may not know what application to use to view the attachment.

To change the default application that sylpheed uses to view an attachment that	somebody mailed you, look for a mailcap file like /etc/mailcap or $HOME/.mailcap

For example, you can add a line like this in $HOME/.mailcap if you want to view pdf	files with xpdf:<p>

application/pdf ; xpdf %s

<sect>Conversion of Other Mail Format into Sylpheed (MH Format)

<sect1>Importing Messages of mbox Format<p>
<!-- added 2001/07/20 -->
Sylpheed lets you import messages of the Mbox format from the File menu. First you create 
the mail folder where you want the messages to end up in, then you select File->import 
Mbox file. Use the browse function to select the Mbox file and the Sylpheed mail folder, 
and press Ok. And voila, there is your mail, imported.

That was easy, wasn't it?
