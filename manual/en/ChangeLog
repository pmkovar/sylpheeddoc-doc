2002-07-??

	* syl_013.sgml
	  ...
	  syl_21.sgml: Splitted the syl_013.sgml file 'cause it contains
	  two top level sections (<sect>). Moved the section
	  "Conversion of Other Mail Format into Sylpheed" into syl_014.sgml
	  and moved all the files (from syl_014 to syl_020) one number up 
	  to keep one top level section per file.


2002-06-??

	* syl_001.sgml: Added the copyright notice that points to the 
	  GNU FDL.

	* syl_004.sgml: Added one missing platform (compared to the 
	  INSTALL file in the release), corrected the description of
	  libjconv, added IPv6 and OpenSSL support.

	* syl_006.sgml: Updated against Sylpheed 0.7.5 (file menu and
	  edit menu).

   * syl_006.sgml
	  ...
	  syl_019.sgml: Splitted the section 6 into two sections:
	
	   6 => The menu options of Sylpheed.
		7 => Dialogs and views.

	  Propagated the number change, so the sections are moved one 
	  number up (8 becomes 9, 9 becomes 10,...).

	* syl_20.sgml: This (new) section contains the GNU FDL.

	* syl_007.sgml: The new section 7 (dialogs and views), has been 
	  updated with new 0.7.5 snapshots. The "receive" tab description
	  has been updated.
	  The send tab description has been completed.
	  The compose tab description has been completed.
	  Added the privacy tab description (with snapshot).
	  The advanced tab description has been completed (added snapshot).


2002-05-??

	* syl_001.sgml: Added "Template" in the features list. Corrected
	  a typo (english version specific).

	* syl_002.sgml: Inserted the first section 
	   "Starting Sylpheed for the first time", contains the description
		of the "wizard" that shows up the first time you start Sylpheed
		(added the corresponding screenshot: wizard_1.png).

	* syl_004.sgml: Updated the supported systems list to reflect the
	  one from the official Sylpheed page (splitted some lines, added
	  several platforms). added the URLs for each additional 
	  library/software to point to their home page or download site.
