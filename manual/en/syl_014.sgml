<sect>Handling MIME types

<sect1>How Sylpheed checks for Mime types

<p>
When attaching a file to a message (composing a new message), the
MIME type of the attached file is choosen based on the file extension
from the mapping list defined in the <it>mime.types</it> file(s).
Sylpheed defines its MIME type mapping table by loading the
system wide MIME types file, then the user file.
The systeme file is <it>SYSCONFDIR/mime.types</it> (SYSCONFDIR can
be defined a compile time), or if it does not exist, <it>/etc/mime.types</it>.
The user file is <it>$HOME/.sylpheed/mime.types</it>.
<p>
A <it>mime.types</it> file consist of one MIME type definition per line,
each definition line starting with the name of the MIME type, followed by
a space separated list of the corresponding file extensions.
The file can contain empty lines, and comments start with the <tt>#</tt>
character and close at line's end.
<p>
Following is a typical <it>mime.types</it> file (an extract of mine):

<verb>
# This file controls what Internet media types are sent to the client for
# given file extension(s).  Sending the correct media type to the client
# is important so they know how to handle the content of the file.
# The Internet media type registry is at 
# <ftp://ftp.iana.org/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/>.

<p>
If the file can be found or has the wrong format, Sylpheed will assume
the default MIME type for all the attachments: <it>application/octet-stream</it>.
In such a case, the recipients mail client may not know what application 
to use to view the attachment.

<sect1>How Sylpheed handles attachments (reception)
<p>
When opening an attachment (select the attachment, right click and select
<it>Open</it>) Sylpheed uses one of the following methods to determine
the application to launch:

<itemize>
	<item>
		The attachment is an image: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>mime_image_viewer</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). If no application is defined, or
		if the format of the definition is not valid, the default application
		command is <it>display</it> (ImageMagick viewer).
	</item>
	<item>
		The attachment is a sound file: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>mime_audio_player</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). If no application is defined, or
		if the format of the definition is not valid, the default application
		command is <it>play</it>.
	</item>
	<item>
		The attachment is a HTML file: the application is the one defined by the
		<it>uri_cmd</it> variable of the common preferences configuration
		file (<it>$HOME/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc</it>). This can also be changed in the
		<it>Common preferences</it>, by changing the <it>Web browser</it> defined
		in the <it>Other</it> tab.
	</item>
	<item>
		Any other attachment type: Sylpheed relies on <it>metamail</it> to use
		the correct application (Sylpheed starts <it>metamail</it> giving it
		the attachment file and the MIME type taken from the mail).
	</item>
</itemize>

<p>
The binding of the applications to each MIME type is defined in the
<it>mailcap</it> file. The systeme wide file is <it>/etc/mailcap</it>, 
while the user file is <it>$HOME/.mailcap</it>.

<p>
In the mailcap file, there is one definition per line, big lines
can be broken by escaping the newline with a <it>\</it> character,
the first element of the line is the MIME type, then a semi-colon,
(<it>;</it>), and finally the application to launch.
The application part (right side of the semi-colon) can contain several
shell commands separated by an escaped semi-colon (<it>\;</it>) and
the <it>%s</it> string is replaced by the name of the file when
launching the command.

<p>
Following is a typical <it>mailcap</it> file (an extract of mine):

<verb>

image/*; ee %s

video/mpeg; gtv %s
video/*; xanim %s

application/pdf; xpdf %s

text/html; dillo %s
