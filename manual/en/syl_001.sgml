<sect1>Introduction to Sylpheed.
<p>
Sylpheed is a fast e-mail and news client. It will run on just about any Linux or Unix compliant system.
<p>
Sylpheed is
<itemize>
<item>light on system resources
<item>very fast
<item>easy to learn and operate, due to its graceful and sophisticated interface

<sect1>Interface
<p>
Sylpheed's appearance and interface are familiar to users of other popular
e-mail clients for Windows such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The
interface also emulates the mailers on Emacsen.
<p>
Messages are managed by MH format, and Sylpheed can work with other MH
format -based mailers (like Mew). You can also use fetchmail or/and
procmail, and external programs for receiving (like inc or imget).

<sect1>Methods for managing messages<p>
<!-- added 2001/09/06 -->
There are several ways to manage messages. The best known is <tt>not at all.</tt><p>
Many people receive an unmanageable amount of e-mail, which usually ends up
in the INBOX folder, ignored and forgotten.
If you are one of these people,
you are constantly trying to locate that one important email you got 5 days
ago in a inbox that contains more than 5000 messages. Locating one email out
of very many unsorted messages is always a time-consuming and frustrating
experience.
<p>
Sylpheed helps this situation with its <tt>mailfolders and mailboxes.</tt>.
<p>
Different mailboxes can store different kinds of mails. Suppose you are a
member of a kiting club, and you get at least 30 e-mails per day from that
club. You can create a separate kiting club mailbox, in which you can move
any e-mail that comes from this club. You will always have all your kiting
e-mails in one place.
<p>
Tedious, you say, to move 30 mails a day to that box, when email comes in at
random moments? It is certain that you will miss that very important email
about transport to the kiting ground where you will have the contest of
biggest and most beautiful kite!
<p>
Well, for this situation there is also a solution- <tt>filters</tt>.
<p>
Filters can automate the process of moving e-mails to new mailboxes. Further on in this manual 
you will also learn about setting up filters, so you do not have to manually move these kiting e-mails 
to the kiting club mailbox.
<p>
<sect2>Okay, so what is the difference between a mailbox and a mailfolder?
<p>
This is the same way you organize information on your harddisk. You create
directories in which you put files or more directories.
<p>
In Sylpheed, you can create mailboxes within mailboxes For example, you
could create a mailbox (folder) that contains the mailboxes for all the
different mailing lists to which you belong .
<p>
A word of clarification- In Sylpheed, a maillbox is nothing more than a
directory. In a directory you can create either a new directory or files.
Sylpheed stores each e-mail in a separate file on disk. An example of how a
mailbox tree could look is

As you can see, there is no real limit to the way you can set up your
mailboxes. As long as you have diskspace available, you can create mailboxes
and mailboxes within mailboxes.
<p>
Of course, you should observe some common sense when you start creating
mailboxes. It is not a good idea to keep all mail in one place but to create
a maze of mailboxes is not a good idea either!

<sect1>Features for the future<p>
This is a special chapter. As with all open source programs, many features
can be requested by you, the user of Sylpheed. The best way to join in on
the talks is to join one of the mailing lists on Sylpheed. For this, you can
turn to the Information section of this manual and read up on how to join a
mailing list.
