<sect>What is Sylpheed?

<sect1>Introduction to Sylpheed.
<p>
Sylpheed is a fast e-mail and news client. It will run on just about any Linux or Unix compliant system.
<p>
The power of Sylpheed is that it is
<itemize>
<item>light on resources
<item>very fast
<item>intuitive for most people
<item>easy to work with
<item>loaded with features
<item>graceful and sophisticated in its interface
</itemize>
</sect1>

<sect1>Interface
<p>
The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.
<p>
The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it together with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can also utilize fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs for receiving (like inc or imget).
