In the log window, you can see what Sylpheed is doing. Keeping 
track of things in that way is very good when you suspect there 
is something wrong. You can paste the info of the log window 
into an e-mail and send it to the developer or the mailing list.
</sect1>

<sect1>Configuration menu
<p>
In the Configuration menu, clearly, you can set up Sylpheed 
the way you want it to work and react.

<itemize>
	<item>
		Common preferences: in this option you will be 
		presented a dialog in which you can select a number 
		of tabs. Each tab represents a specific set of settings 
		in Sylpheed. In the next chapter, these dialog options 
		are explained in more detail.
	</item>
	<item>
		Filter setting: this option shows you a dialog in which you 
		can set up the filtering rules that you want Sylpheed 
		to process on receiving new e-mails. You first specify 
		on which part(s) of the e-mail Sylpheed has to check, 
		and then you tell Sylpheed what to do. You can move the 
		message to a different directory (including trash to get 
		rid of spam mail). Selecting the destination folder is 
		possible through a browser window that comes up when you 
		press "Select..."
		<p>
		You can choose not to receive the e-mail. Note that 
		this will leave the message on the mailserver of your 
		provider, the message will not be removed!
		<p>
		When you press the "Register" button, the filter 
		rule is added to the list of rules. Do you select 
		"Substitute", then the selected rule is replaced by the 
		information of the setting entered. "Delete" in the end 
		will delete the selected filtering rule.
		<p>
		Please note that you can set up two selections for a rule, 
		which can be "OR'd" or "AND'd". OR means that one of the 
		two selections will have to match for the rule to be 
		executed. AND means that both selections have to match 
		before an action is performed.
		<p>
		To the right of the selection rules you see buttons 
		called UP and DOWN. You can move rules up and down in 
		the list. This will often trigger different behaviour 
		in the selections, so consider the order in which 
		you set the rules.
	</item>
	<item>
		Template: let your create a new message template.
		When composing a new message you can then used one
		of the defined templates and insert it (or use it to
		completely replace the content of your mail).
		The templates can contain some special characters
		that are replaced when the template is used in order
		to create a dynamic text. Use the symbols button on
		the templates definition window to see the list of
		the available symbols.
	</item>
	<item>
		Actions: let your create new commands to be added to the
		'Tools/Actions' menu. An action is a command that processes
		the select part of a message, the message body or the complete
		message file. It can be a background process, used as a filter
		(reads, modifies and replaces a message),...
	</item>
	<item>
		Preferences for current account: here you can set the 
		specifics for the account you are currently using. 
		Should mail be deleted after fetching, what is the 
		server it comes from, etc. Basically it is the same 
		dialog form as shown in setting up a new account.
	</item>
	<item>
		Create new account: here you name the account (each 
		account has a recognizable name), you set up your name 
		and e-mail address etc. You set up the type of server 
		you access (POP4, IMAP4, local mailbox, newsserver) 
		and where the downloaded messages have to go (default 
		folder is the inbox). In the RECEIVE tab you select or 
		unselect options, in SEND you can set up how to send 
		your messages. In COMPOSE you can point to a specific 
		signature file, and in ADVANCED you can set up alternate 
		ports for the server, if these exist. (Do not mess 
		with these unless you are sure you have to!!)
	</item>
	<item>
		Edit accounts: here you can select one of the accounts 
		you created, from a list, and edit the information about 
		them. Note that you cannot edit an account for which 
		you are writing a message at the same time. This to 
		ensure data integrity.
	</item>
	<item>
		Change current account: here you can select what 
		account you want to use, to write a message.
		If you have enabled the status bar (in the view menu),
		the name of the current account is shown in the bottom
		right corner of the Sylpheed window (in the status bar)
		and can be changed by a click on it (then a menu appears
		and lists all your accounts).
	</item>
