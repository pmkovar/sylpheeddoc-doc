<sect1>Changing Key Binding of Short-Cut Key
<p>
Sylpheed's graphical interface is based on GTK. This means 
that it is very simple to change the key binding 
(shortcut key, hotkey) for menu items. If you are used to 
a certain key combination from another program, you can tell 
Sylpheed to use that same key combination.
<p>
The procedure is very simple. Suppose you want to change the 
key binding for getting new mail (message menu) from Alt-I 
to Ctrl-M.
<p>

<itemize>
	<item>
		Open the message menu with the mouse or by 
		pressing Alt-M
	</item>
	<item>
		Select the "get new mail" option (do not click it, 
		this will activate the function!). If you use the
		mouse, just move the mouse cursor over the option.
	</item>
	<item>
		Now you press Ctrl-M. You will immediately see the 
		new key combination appear on the menu.
	</item>
</itemize>

Congratulations, you have just changed a key binding. 
This way you can change all the options that you want. 
Do note that it is best to use just the alt, shift and 
ctrl key combinations. Several functions within Sylpheed 
are called up by one-key actions which are programmed in.

<sect2>Predefined shortcuts
<p>
	You can also choose among predefined shortcuts lists,
	from the preference settings. Open the <it>Common preferences</it>
	window, choose the <it>Interface</it> tab, click the 
	<it>Set key bindings</it> button. Select one of the predefined
	set of key bindings from the list found in the new window
	that pops up.

<sect1>Changing Fonts on Menu, etc.

<p>
If you want to change the font that shows the menu of Sylpheed, 
this is controlled by the window manager that you are using. 
You have to go into the setup of the window manager (KDE, Gnome, XFCE) 
and change the font to your desired one.

<p>
Changing the font of the views of Sylpheed is done by selecting 
<tt>Common preferences</tt> in the Configuration menu. There you select 
the <tt>Display</tt> tab, and in the first section of the window you 
can browse the fonts available on your computer.

<sect1>How to tell another program to use Sylpheed as e-mail program

<p>
If you wish to use Sylpheed from within for example Netscape or Opera, 
then you need to go to the `preferences` section, then choose 
`applications` and in the email client part, you need to enter 
<tt>sylpheed --compose</tt>.

<sect1>Data Format of Address Book
<p>
The addressbook is located in ~/.sylpheed. It is named 
addressbook.xml. As you may guess it from its extension, 
the format is XML.
The general format of the addressbook is:
<p>

<code>
&lt addressbook &gt<p>
 &lt common_address &gt<p>
    &lt group name="Common addresses" &gt<p>
    &lt item &gt<p>
     &lt name &gt Paul &lt /name &gt<p>
     &lt address &gt paul@nlpagan.net &lt /address &gt<p>
     &lt remarks &gt Writes Sylph. manual &lt /remarks &gt<p>
	&lt /item &gt<p>
    &lt /group &gt<p>
 &lt /common_address &gt<p>
&lt /addressbook &gt
</code>
