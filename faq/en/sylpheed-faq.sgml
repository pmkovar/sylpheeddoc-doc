<sect1>
Q02 What is Sylpheed?<p>
A. Sylpheed is an e-mail client (& news reader) based on
GTK+, running on the X Window System, and aiming for
 <itemize>
 <item>Quick response
 <item>Graceful, and sophisticated interface
 <item>Easy configuration, intuitive operation
 <item>Abundant features
 </itemize>
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q03 Where can I get Sylpheed?<p>
A. You can download it from <tt><url url="http://sylpheed.good-day.net" name="sylpheed.good-day.net"></tt>
There are links to download the tarball sources, and
also links to sites where you can download RPM's (for
Redhat and Mandrake), DEB packages for Debian, and
installations for Solaris and FreeBSD.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q04 Who writes Sylpheed?<p>
A. Hiroyuki Yamamoto (<tt>hiro-y@kcn.ne.jp</tt>)
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q05 What does the name Sylpheed mean?<p>
A. It means 'light weight', like air. This comes from the
name of the wind spirits, the Sylphs.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q06 How does Sylpheed store mails?<p>
A. Mails are stored in the MH mailfile format as used by MH
and EMH. Maildir and mbox format are not (yet)
supported, although it is possible to import an mbox
file into a Sylpheed mailbox.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q07 Why does the auto collection of mail not work?<p>
A. Autocollection works since version 0.5.1. If you need it
or want it, you should upgrade.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q08 Does Sylpheed have mail filtering?<p>
A. Yes. You can find it in Configuration -> filtering tab.<p>
 Please note that filtering is not yet implemented for IMAP accounts.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q09 Can Sylpheed handle IMAP mail?<p>
A. Yes. As of version 0.4.99 IMAP is supported.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q10 Can Sylpheed handle local unix mailboxes?<p>
A. Yes.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q11 Can Sylpheed handle IPv6?<p>
A. Yes, IPv6 is fully supported in Sylpheed.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q12 Does Sylpheed support encryption like GPG?<p>
A. Yes. GPG is implemented and works fine. For activating it in Sylpheed, see Q14 in the Installation section.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q13 How does Sylpheed check for MIME types?<p>
A. Sylpheed uses the Mutt type of mime checking.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q14 Does Sylpheed allow me to write HTML styled messages?<p>
A. No. A discussion has gone around over this topic, and
the outcome was that HTML mail is not wanted. If you
really need to send HTML, you can of course attach a
webpage to an e-mail. Several patches have been made to
facilitate better HTML handling in Sylpheed. You can
find these patches at the Sylpheed Patch Page (see
further down in the document).
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q15  Does Sylpheed have name completion in the address fields?<p>
A.   Yes. When you search for a name that starts with "<tt>don</tt>",
type "<tt>don</tt>" (without the quotes) and press the TAB key.
This will show you the correct name (when only one "don"
exists in your addressbook. Otherwise a dropdown list
appears, which allows you to select the name you want.
E.g. Donald Duck, Don Johnson. But also e-mail addresses
starting with "<tt>don</tt>" will appear in the list (like
"<tt>don.giovanni@maffia.org</tt>").
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q16  Fine, but when I hit the TAB key I get an error message.<p>
A.   When you want to use name completion, make sure that
there are names in your address book. If there are no
names, even Sylpheed has a hard time completing
something.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q17  Why is Sylpheed so fast?<p>
A.   That's what it is designed for!
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q18  Where can I get the current patches for Sylpheed?<p>
A.   The Sylpheed Patch homepage:
<tt><url url="http://www.teledix.net/sylpheed/" name="The sylpheed patch homepage"></tt>
(Also see section on Installation on how to install a
patch)
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q19  How can I send in patches, report bugs, talk about Sylpheed with others?<p>
A.   To talk to others, you should join the Sylpheed mailing
list at <tt>http://sylpheed.good-day.net</tt>. Note that there is
a japanese and an english list, so pick the right one!
If you have made a patch that you want the world to know
of, please get in touch with the manager of the Sylpheed
Patch homepage, at <tt>sylpheed@thewildbeast.co.uk</tt>
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q20  When I send mail, the Content-Type header says the mail is in US-ASCII, even when I specified ISO-8859-1?<p>
A.   If ISO-8859-1 characters (>= 0x80) are not used in the
message body, Sylpheed will automatically set the
charset value in the Content-Type header as US-ASCII.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q21  Why does it look like word wrap is not working?<p>
A.   Word wrapping is a bit peculiar perhaps. You can type
lines as long as you like. By the time you send or queue
a mail with long lines, Sylpheed will first wrap the
lines to the line length you set up, and then the mail
is queued. This is more convenient than you think. Once
a line is wrapped (hard line breaks are inserted in the
text) and you add something in a line there, the next
line will move to a separate new line, leaving one or
two words from the previous line "hanging there" alone.
E.g.
<verb>
     This is a long line
     is wrapped.
</verb>
<p>
Now you add one word in the first line:
<verb>
     This is a very long line
     that
     is wrapped
</verb>
<p>
This would cause you a lot of manual reformatting to get
a presentable mail again.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q22 Where can I find the latest FAQ on Sylpheed?<p>
A. Go to <url url="http://sylpheeddoc.sf.net" name="http://sylpheeddoc.sf.net"> and check out the FAQ and manual from the sylpheeddoc project. Both documents are available in multiple languages there and usually contain the latest updates.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q23  Can I import a mbox into Sylpheed's MH mailfolders?<p>
A.   Yes, just create/select the folder you want your
mails in, and select "Import mbox file" in the File
menu.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q24  Can I use procmail to sort my mails with the MH mail handling?<p>
A.   Yes. Just make sure that you add /. to the end of a rule so procmail knows you are filtering into an MH mail folder. Example:<p>
<tt>0:</tt><p>
<tt>* ^Subject:.*sylpheed</tt><p>
<tt>  sylpheedmail/.</tt><p>
Check man procmail for details.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q25  When I upgrade Sylpheed, are there things I should be aware of?<p>
A.   Yes!<p>
Upgrade to 0.4.50: you should reconfigure your newsgroup settings<p>
Upgrade to 0.4.63: you should set the URL string colors from the Configuration menu.<p>
Upgrade to 0.4.65: some menu items have been moved<p>
Upgrade to 0.7.3: many keybindings have changed
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q26  How can I quickly update the views in Sylpheed?<p>
A.   Just press Alt-U or select "update" from the summary menu.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q27  Why can't I use gvim as external editor?<p>
A.   If one wishes to use gvim as an external editor it's necessary to start it with the no-fork option -f, i.e. in the configuration dialog box you need to enter  "gvim -f %s". If not the editor forks and open up a separate file and when one quits the editor the changes are lost and don't show up in the composer window.<p>
(Thanks, Ed Collins!)

Sylpheed FAQ - Installation and Configuration

<sect1>
Q01  What does it take to compile Sylpheed?<p>
A.   Any POSIX compliant UNIX or similar OS eg. Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris
GTK+ 1.2.6 or later
A recent ANSI C compiler (gcc 2.7.2.3 should also
work)
Note: it is reported that Sun C will not compile
Sylpheed.
Optionally:
<itemize>
<item>Imlib or gdk-pixbuf (for built-in image view)
<item>libcompface (for X-Face)
<item>libjconv (for I18N)
<item>GPGME (for GnuPG)
<item>the equivalent of GTK+-devel and Xfree86-devel.
</itemize>
Otherwise ./configure will fail.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q02 How do I set up Sylpheed?<p>
A.   When you run Sylpheed for the first time, it will
ask you where you want to store your mailboxes. The
default is &lt;homedir&gt;/Mail. You can change this to
anything you like as long as it is a valid directory
name.<p>
Please note: When Sylpheed is executed for the first time, it automatically creates the configuration files under $HOME/.sylpheed/, and asks you the location of mailbox. The default is $HOME/Mail. If some files which are non-MH format already exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q03 Why did the creation of the mailbox fail?<p>
A.   Sylpheed reports such an error if it can't create the default
mailboxes (inbox, outbox, etc ...). This can be because &lt;homedir&gt;/Mail
already contains files with the same names. This occurs when switching from
Kmail to Sylpheed, in this case backup and remove the existing Mail
directory or use another name for the Sylpheed mail directory.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q04  How do I set up an account?<p>
A.   After loading Sylpheed for the first time, you can
add an e-mail account by clicking the
"Configuration" menu. Select the option "Create new
account" and fill in the appropriate fields.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q05  How many accounts can I set up in Sylpheed?<p>
A.   The number is unlimited. The limit is reached when
your computer stops responding.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q06 Why does Sylpheed not delete my mails when I press "delete"? I set a filter, and Sylpheed does not filter. I moved a mail to a different mailbox and it did not move.<p>
A.   You have to click the "execute" button.
The other solution: in the configuration settings
(common preferences -> interface tab) you have to
check the "execute commands immediately" box.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q07  Can I set up special addresses/ports for my mailserver / newsserver?<p>
A.   Yes, you can. In the configuration per account you
can specify the exact port addresses you want to use.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q08  Does Sylpheed have options for threading messages?<p>
A.   Yes. You can switch it on and off in the Summary
     Menu, just select "Thread View" or press Ctrl+T.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q09  Can I create multiple levels of subfolders to store mail?<p>
A.   Absolutely. This is no problem.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q10  Why isn't Sylpheed sending my mail out?<p>
A.   You need to create at least one account in order to
     send. (This is a wonderful gotcha on LAN installs
     with only a local mailbox feed).
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q11  How do I apply a patch after downloading it?<p>
A.   Copy patch to sylpheed directory
     Apply the patch:
<p>
     <tt>&percnt; patch -p0 &lt; some.patch</tt>
<p>
     Or, if it's gzipped:
<p>
     <tt>&percnt; gzip -dc some.patch.gz &verbar; patch -p0</tt>
<p>
     Run <tt>./autogen.sh</tt>, remove the generated <tt>/config.cache</tt>
     file (unless you want to install in prefix
     <tt>/usr/local</tt>).
     Run <tt>./configure</tt> with the appropriate options and
     then <tt>make</tt>.
     (Text as found on the Sylpheed patches page.)
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q12  How do I compile in support for compface pictures?<p>
A.   You have to have a package called <tt>libcompface</tt>
     installed, so this is available for compiling into
     Sylpheed.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q13  How do I make my own compface image?<p>
A.   The faces package contains a program called xbm2ikon script,
 which converts a 48x48 xbm to the format suitable for
 compface. Thanks to Jeff Dairiki, you can have a complete online course in this. Visit <url url="http://www.dairiki.org/xface/" name="this page"> for the details.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q14 How can I tell my browser/newsclient/other program to use Sylpheed as e-mail program?<p>
A.  In the settings part of the program, write
       <tt>sylpheed --compose</tt>
</sect1>

<sect1>Q15 How do I enable GPG support in Sylpheed?<p>
A.  When compiling Sylpheed, make sure you add <tt>--enable-gpgme</tt> in the ./configure command.
When that completes successfully, there is a "privacy" section in the Common preferences.
</sect1>

<sect1>Q16 Mutt does not recognize Sylpheed's MH structure<p>
A. For this to work you need to use the "touch" command in every MH folder. "touch" the file .xmhcache and Mutt should do just fine.
</sect1>

<sect1>Q17 Viewing a GIF file within Sylpheed causes a segmentation fault.<p>
A. In case this happens, you can easily fix that by adding the following to /etc/mime.types:<p>
<tt>image/gif              gif</tt>
</sect1>

<sect1>Q18 How can I make Sylpheed notify me when new mail arrives?<p>
A. For this you can do several things:<p>
* Look at the Sylpheed patch page at <url url="http://www.teledix.net/sylpheed/" name="Teledix.net"> for a new mail patch.<p>
* Download Gkrellm or a similar program that is able to notify you of new incoming mail. Gkrellm is available at <url url="http://www.gkrellm.net" name="the Gkrellm page">

</sect>

<sect>
Sylpheed FAQ - Interface

<sect1>
Q01  How do I make Sylpheed display my language?<p>
A.   You have to set some environment variables such as
     <tt>LANG,LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES</tt> to your local language.
     Usually <tt>LANG</tt> (or <tt>LC_ALL</tt>) is sufficient.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q02  I don't like the default font. Can I change that?<p>
A.   Yes. In Configuration->common preferences under the
     "Display" tab.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q03  There are too many columns in the message list!!<p>
A.   In Configuration->common preferences under the
     "Display" tab you can press the button "Set display
     item of summary". That pops up a screen with all the
     options you can show or leave out of the message
     list.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q04  Can I use a different editor to write my mails?<p>
A.   You can. In Configuration->common preferences under
     the "Other" tab you can define your editor of choice.
     Remember, if you want to use a command line editor
     like vi or emacs, to write the name of the shell
     (term, term, rxvt) with the -e parameter in front of
     the editor. E.g.: <tt>rxvt -e vi &percnt;s</tt>
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q05  How to change the font size in the Sylpheed interface?<p>
A.   You can set the GTK+ font by <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt>, or
     <tt>~/.gtkrc.mine</tt>,
     (which is included by <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt>).
     For example:
     <tt>style "default"
     {
     font =

"-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
"
     }
     widget_class "*"        style "default"</tt>
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q06  Sylpheed saves my outgoing mail (in Outbox). Can I make it stop doing that?<p>
A.   In Configuration->common preferences there's a
     checkbox "Save sent message to outbox". Uncheck it,
     and it's solved.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q07  How can I change the key-bindings (hot-keys) in Sylpheed?<p>
A.   That is very simple. Suppose you want to assign a
     shortcut key to a function, e.g. sending all mail
     out should start when you press Ctrl-Y. Click the
      Message' menu and move the mouse over "Send all
     messages". Now you press Ctrl-Y. Immediately the menu
     text is updated and the function is in place. Please
     note that a previous function that Ctrl-Y was
     assigned to, will no longer have a shortcut key. If
     you want to remove the key binding, do the same
     thing, but press the "delete" key on the menu-item.
     Then the key binding is removed.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q08  Can I close windows without the mouse?<p>
A.   Of course!! Not all windows, but by pressing ESCape,
     you can close the addressbook, the window of viewing
     a mail-source (message->view source), the window of
     viewing the headers, and several others. Just give
     it a try and you will find all of them.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q09  Can I change the way the date is displayed in the message summary?<p>
A.   As of 0.4.65 you can. The options are:
     &percnt;y = year in numbers     &percnt;m = month in number
     &percnt;d = day in numbers      &percnt;c = date/time for locale
     &percnt;A = full weekday name   &percnt;a = short month name
     &percnt;B = full month name     &percnt;b = short month name
     &percnt;H = hours in 24-clock   &percnt;I = hours in 12-clock
     For more information go to the configuration menu,
     select Common preferences / Display and move the
     mouse cursor over the input box for the date display
     format.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q10  Why can't I see the compface pictures?<p>
A.   You need to enable displaying of the header pane in the
     general preferences
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q11  I still can't see the pictures. Why not?<p>
A.   You may not have compiled in Compface support. See Q11
     in the Installation/Configuration section.
</sect1>

<sect1>
Q12  Why does the URL Launcher not launch my webbrowser?<p>
A.   You need to double-click the url.
</sect1>
<sect1>Q13 Attachments with spaces in the name won't open!<p>
A.   When you try to launch a helper application, like an image viewer, with an attachment that has spaces in the name, put quotes around the %s
parameter. Example: gedit '%s'

    PREAMBLE

    <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</p>

    <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

    <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

    <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p>

    <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p>

    <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</p>

    <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p>

    <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</p>

    <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</p>

    VERBATIM COPYING

    <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>

    <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COPYING IN QUANTITY

    <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</p>

    <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</p>

    <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</p>

    <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    MODIFICATIONS

    <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

    <p><itemize>
      <item>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </item>

      <item>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
      together with at least five of the principal authors of the
      Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than
      five).
      </item>

      <item>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
      publisher.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve all the
      copyright notices of the Document.
      </item>

      <item>Add an appropriate
      copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
      copyright notices.
      </item>

      <item>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
      Texts given in the Document's license notice.
      </item>

      <item>Include an unaltered
      copy of this License.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
      </item>

      <item>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.
      </item>

      <item>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.
      </item>

      <item>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.
      </item>

      <item>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.
      </item>
    </itemize>
    
    <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</p>

    <p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</p>

    <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</p>

    <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COMBINING DOCUMENTS

    <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</p>

    <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</p>

    <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

    <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</p>

    <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</p>

    <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    TRANSLATION

    <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    TERMINATION
    
    <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <url url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" name="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">.</p>

    <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    How to use this License for your documents

    <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>

<p><tt>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</tt></p>

    <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</p>

    <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</p>
