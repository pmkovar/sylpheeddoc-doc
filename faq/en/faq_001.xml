          <para>
         No. A discussion has gone around over this topic, and
         the outcome was that HTML mail is not wanted. If you
         really need to send HTML, you can of course attach a
         webpage to an e-mail. Several patches have been made to
         facilitate better HTML handling in Sylpheed. You can
         find these patches at the Sylpheed Patch Page (see
         further down in the document).

      </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
         Yes. When you search for a name that starts with &quot;<literal>don</literal>&quot;,
         type &quot;<literal>don</literal>&quot; (without the quotes) and press the TAB key.
         This will show you the correct name (when only one &quot;don&quot;
         exists in your addressbook. Otherwise a dropdown list
         appears, which allows you to select the name you want.
         E.g. Donald Duck, Don Johnson. But also e-mail addresses
         starting with &quot;<literal>don</literal>&quot; will appear in the list (like
         &quot;<literal>don.giovanni@maffia.org</literal>&quot;).

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
         When you want to use name completion, make sure that
         there are names in your address book. If there are no
         names, even Sylpheed has a hard time completing
         something.

          <para>
         If ISO-8859-1 characters (&gt;= 0x80) are not used in the
         message body, Sylpheed will automatically set the
         charset value in the Content-Type header as US-ASCII.

        <question id="faq-word-wrap-sylpheed">
          <para>
         Why does it look like word wrap is not working?
      </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
         Word wrapping is a bit peculiar perhaps. You can type
         lines as long as you like. By the time you send or queue
         a mail with long lines, Sylpheed will first wrap the
         lines to the line length you set up, and then the mail
         is queued. This is more convenient than you think. Once
         a line is wrapped (hard line breaks are inserted in the
         text) and you add something in a line there, the next
         line will move to a separate new line, leaving one or
         two words from the previous line &quot;hanging there&quot; alone.
         E.g.
        <literallayout>
           This is a long line that
           is wrapped.
        </literallayout>
     
        Now you add one word in the first line:
        <literallayout>
           This is a very long line
           that
           is wrapped
        </literallayout>

        This would cause you a lot of manual reformatting to get
        a presentable mail again.

        Note: As of Sylpheed 0.8.0., active wordwrap has been
        implemented. You can turn it on in Common 
        Preferences-&gt;Compose-&gt;wrap on input.

        <answer>
          <para>
         If one wishes to use gvim as an external editor it&apos;s
         necessary to start it with the no-fork option -f, i.e. 
         in the configuration dialog box you need to enter  
         &quot;gvim -f %s&quot;. If not the editor forks and open up a 
         separate file and when one quits the editor the changes
         are lost and don&apos;t show up in the composer window.

         How does selective download work?
      </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          There are two ways using it.</para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Manually: Open &quot;Tools/Selective download&quot; and 
            choose &quot;Fetch&quot; to retrieve the mail headers. Afterwards, 
            select the mails to delete and pres the remove button.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Automatic: Create a -global- filtering rule to 
            delete mails on server. If you then choose &quot;Selective
            download&quot;, all mails that conform to this rule are marked 
            for deletion.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>Note: By default, selective download only retrieves new (unread) messages.
        If you want to process the read mails also, you need to set &quot;retrieve
        all messages&quot;.

        <question id="faq-two-filter-options-sylpheed-claws">
          <para>
         Why are there two filter options?
      </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
         &quot;Filter setting&quot; is the traditional one with less options. 
          The &quot;Filtering&quot; option is new in sylpheed-claws and more 
          powerful and may replace the  old option in the future.
          Tip: To convert your old filter rules into the new format, 
          you can use the &quot;filter_conv.pl&quot; script, that can be found 
          in &quot;tools&quot; subdirectory from sylphed-claws sources.

         Can I use both filter options?
      </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
         No, as soon as you define a new &quot;filtering&quot; rule, the
         traditional &quot;filter&quot; rules are ignored.
